🚀 Excited to Share My Latest Java Project: A Simple Calculator! 🚀

I recently completed a project where I built a console-based calculator application using Java. This calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Features:
User-friendly interface with clear prompts
Supports multiple calculations in one session
Handles basic input validation to ensure accurate operations
Working on this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java fundamentals, such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling. I’m eager to explore more complex applications and enhance my programming skills further.

Check out my code snippet below and let me know what you think! I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
